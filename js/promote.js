// ======================================================================
// PROMOTION QUEUE — what is on the beta channel and not yet in production.
//
// Rendered in Help, and ONLY on a non-production host, so a customer on
// tuno.limon-it.nl never sees a list of things they do not have.
//
// Same discipline as ENCA's js/promote.js (read its header for the long
// version — the rules were learned the hard way there and apply unchanged):
//
//   * HAND-MAINTAINED. The app is static files in a browser: it cannot read
//     git or diff two branches. A stale list is worse than none, because it
//     will be trusted. Every change that lands on `beta` updates this file
//     in the same commit — like the changelog entry, the home-tile tag and
//     js/version.js.
//   * `n` is stable and hand-assigned so an item can be referred to out loud
//     ("push number 3 to main"). NEVER renumbered, never reused after an
//     item ships; the next new item takes the next free number.
//   * ONE ITEM PER CHANGE — only work that must ship together shares a
//     number. "Push 3" has to mean one decision.
//   * Never queue documentation (roadmap cards, changelog entries, this
//     file): it travels with whatever promotion happens next.
//   * PROMOTING AN ITEM IS FIVE STEPS: 1) delete the item here and bump
//     `productionBuild`; 2) set the roadmap card ON MAIN to `live · build
//     NNN`; 3) set the SAME card ON BETA to `live · beta NNNNN · production
//     NNN` (the step that gets missed); 4) add the changelog entry on both
//     channels; 5) RELABEL THE CHIPS ON MAIN — BETA is channel language and
//     never ships to production: a tool new to production wears NEW, one an
//     item changed wears UPDATED, the rest wear nothing (Mihai's rule,
//     production build 10; main-check enforces it). Before promoting, verify each item against what `main`
//     actually contains — `git show main:<file> | grep <marker>` — and do
//     not trust this queue's own list.
//   * `risk`: high (a real problem in production until it lands) / medium
//     (missing capability, nothing broken) / low (convenience or docs).
//   * `test[]` is NOT optional. `why` says what the risk is and what would
//     have to be true for the item to graduate; it does not say how to find
//     out. Each `test` step does: it names the tenant/policy state it needs
//     and the outcome you should see, so a step can FAIL rather than be
//     nodded through. Where a check needs a tenant nobody has to hand, say
//     so in the step — knowing which check was skipped is worth more than a
//     list that pretends all of them were run. An item with no `test[]`
//     renders as "not written" on purpose: it is not finished.
//   * `files[]` must list every file the change actually depends on,
//     INCLUDING the ones that touch it at runtime. Item 2 (the TUNO mark)
//     listed the three SVGs and index.html but not css/app.css, which
//     carries the dark-mode swap as a content:url, nor js/branding.js,
//     which sets the logo src from its own copy of the path — unversioned
//     there, it would have overwritten the cache-busting in the HTML and
//     served the old mark anyway. A promotion built from an incomplete
//     files[] fails at exactly the thing the item was for. Found while
//     promoting it; both were caught by reading the tree rather than the
//     list.
//   * `staying[]` records what is deliberately NOT promoted, so absence
//     reads as a decision rather than an oversight.
//
// This site's own version is APP_BUILD.label — never hand-maintain a beta
// build number here. Only `productionBuild` stays by hand, because the app
// cannot know what the other channel runs.
// ======================================================================
const PROMOTE = {
  // Verified against `git show main:js/version.js` — main is at build 11.
  // Promotions: items 1-13 (beta 10301-10317) as build 3, items 14-19
  // (10318-10323) as build 4, items 20-29 (10324-10336) as build 5, items
  // 30-35 (10342, 10344-10348) as build 6, items 36-40 plus 45-52 and

  // items 44, 58, 59 and 63-67 (10360, 10378-10380, 10384-10405 less the
  // held builds) as build 8 — the second partial promotion.
  //
  // Build 10 is main-only: the chip relabel (BETA off production, NEW and
  // UPDATED on), a channel transform like the roadmap tags, made a standing
  // promotion step at the same time.
  //
  // Items 41-43, 60-62 and 68-96 (beta 10357-10448) went as build 9 — the
  // FULL-QUEUE promotion, and the first ordered by the exported promotion
  // file (item 93's own feature, eating its own dog food).
  //
  // THE QUEUE IS EMPTY. Every tool on this channel is also in production;
  // the only differences left are the two permanent ones in staying[]. An
  // empty queue is a state worth returning to: it means "beta and main
  // match", and the next item added is the whole of the next promotion.

Four changes, all inside the DOM-free engine. (1) partlyEnforced(reach, deviceCount) is extracted as the ONE predicate for the claim: a fraction needs a denominator, so no fleet size means no claim; a filtered tenant-wide target whose rule could not be evaluated is partial (\u0022at most all N\u0022 is not all N); an unreadable member count is unknown, not partial. (2) verdictWord() now takes the reach OBJECT instead of a bare number and reads that predicate \u2014 which also fixes a filter-capped sum at or above the fleet being headed \u0022enforced now\u0022. (3) widenLine() writes the missing sentence in three shapes: a countable remainder quotes it against the fleet, a filter-narrowed statement names the FILTER as the cause and refuses to quote a remainder a browser cannot compute, and an unreadable reach says so. (4) afterRolloutClause() fixes the number a live partial WITH a staged policy was being given: the destination line stated the staged policy's own target, but the reader's question is coverage AFTER rollout, which is the union of two sets whose membership nobody read \u2014 so it is a range (at least the larger, at most the sum, capped at the fleet) and is refused outright when either side is a filter ceiling or a floored sum.

FIVE :not() CLAUSES WEIGH AS MUCH AS FIVE CLASSES, so the rule its own comment calls the default outranked every field rule in the app — .al-dep-ver's width:72px among them, which is why T01's inline version token has rendered 981px wide since 10466, wrapping its sentence into three lines.

THREE ENTRA RULES SHAPE IT: the isMemberManagementRestricted flag is IMMUTABLE, so buildPayload() sends it only at creation and the editor says there is no convert; a restricted unit with NO scoped administrator is a vault nobody can open, so creating one without naming a keyholder is REFUSED by buildPayload() and the field is prefilled from #tenantUser — whoever creates the unit is its administrator by default, and the grant happens as part of the create rather than as a follow-up somebody forgets; and a role-assignable group inside a restricted unit is 🧊 FROZEN, flagged with T22 named as the exit.

Both are guarded (typed DELETE; a plain warning when the last grant goes) but both are one click from a tenant that behaves differently.

It is a working pane you leave open, not a dialogue — and T23's create/edit/delete keep the full-screen backdrop on purpose, because those must be answered. 10511 MOVES THE DETAIL INTO A MODAL and makes the chips filters. Examine opened by replacing the list, which is the wrong shape for a decision made by comparing one group against the others; it is a gu-modal now (the T02/T07 one), opened BEFORE the read so it can hold its own progress, closed by button, backdrop or Escape — and the delegated click/input/change handlers are bound to BOTH #gmBody and #gmModalBody, because the modal sits outside the body they were on and every control in it would otherwise be dead. Chips gain T19's filter behaviour (all / dynamic / no destination), toggling off when clicked in force; only chips that CAN filter became buttons. The scoped-administrator field is prefilled from #tenantUser — whoever creates the unit is its administrator by default. 10510 IS A CORRECTION TO 10509 AND SHIPS WITH IT: the permissions card is a BUTTON. 10509 rendered the whole inventory — three tables of scopes — above the tool, taller than the tool. It is one button in Read's own action row now, with every scope and what it buys on the tooltip, and the per-scope ✓/○ dropped rather than shrunk, because it reported session-acquired scopes and reads as tenant consent. 10509 FOLDS IN FOUR SCREEN ADDITIONS, one of which DELETES. (1) A PERMISSIONS CARD granting everything the tool will ever ask for in one prompt rather than four across a run — every scope with what it buys, the three directory writes marked, and the incremental route unchanged: Read alone still acquires no write scope, which the suite asserts. The ticks say THIS SESSION HOLDS IT rather than implying tenant consent. (2) A SEARCH BOX over the group list, local to the list already read, matching name or object id. (3) TENANT AUTOFILL on the scoped administrator via the app's one Suggest component — and because Suggest writes into input.value and dispatches NOTHING, the form fields are synced before use rather than subscribed to; a picked administrator that never reached the plan would have read as a refusal with the answer on screen. (4) ARCHIVED CLEANUP — tick the leftovers of earlier migrations and delete them, guarded by a reference check that must run first, refuses any group anything still points at, and is invalidated by changing the selection. Entra soft-deletes, which the screen says. referencesMany() answers for the whole selection in ONE read pass. 10508 FOLDS IN TOO, and it is the one that changes what this item COSTS A CUSTOMER: five delegated permissions go into New-TunoAppRegistration.ps1 — Group.ReadWrite.All, AdministrativeUnit.Read.All, AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All, RoleManagement.Read.Directory, RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory — three of them directory WRITES, and every tenant needs an administrator to consent before the tool runs at all. It fixes the second thing a real tenant found: the unit read had been handed Graph.SCOPES.directory, a constant named `directory` that is [User.Read.All, Group.Read.All] and NOT Directory.Read.All, so the tenant refused with \"Insufficient privileges\"; and because both reads sat in ONE try/catch the screen printed \"Could not read the groups\" about the call that had already succeeded, sending the diagnosis to the wrong half of the tool. The two reads now report separately, each naming the permission it wanted, and a failed unit read degrades to a warning card over a still-correct group list rather than an empty screen — with the plain statement that nothing can be migrated until it works, since without it the 🧊 frozen case is invisible. Also folded in: MEMBER TYPING NO LONGER INFERS. memberIds() read @odata.type off a $select response — which Microsoft's own documented example returns WITHOUT — and treated absent as \"user\"; a service principal, which Entra permits in a role-assignable group, would have been counted as a user and silently not copied. It now reads /members/microsoft.graph.user for the users and /members for the total, and refuses on any difference, naming the object id. 10507 FOLDS IN, and it is the reason this item is not a one-build item: 10506 could not read anything at all. Every administrative-unit call answered \"Resource not found for the segment 'administrativeUnits'\" on the first real tenant, because ENCA talks to /beta where the unit is a top-level collection and TUNO talks to v1.0 where it is nested under /directory — the port carried the path across with the reasoning. Fixed by using v1.0's path rather than moving to beta: the whole resource is GA there, isMemberManagementRestricted included, and a directory WRITE has no business on a preview endpoint. One AU constant now carries the list, the create, the member $ref and the scoped-role grant, and the memberOf read takes v1.0's documented $/ cast form. The headless fake refuses the flat path the way the tenant did. A NEW TOOL, ported from ENCA's ⑦ Migrate. Turns a ROLE-ASSIGNABLE security group into a plain one inside a RESTRICTED MANAGEMENT ADMINISTRATIVE UNIT. js/groupmigrate.js carries the engine (GroupMigrate) and the screen (GroupMigrateTool) in the T11 split. candidates() lists every role-assignable security group server-side via $filter=isAssignableToRole eq true with ConsistencyLevel:eventual. Per group it then reads: heldRoles() (roleAssignments + roleEligibilitySchedules — read-only, RoleManagement.Read.Directory), unitsHolding() (the frozen case), memberIds() split by TYPE, and references() — which is the load-bearing part: the REPOINTABLE half is AssignEdit.readPolicies() by definition, and the OTHER half is GroupUse.analyze() MINUS it, derived by subtraction rather than by source id because GroupUse's config source covers three collections and its compliance source two, only one of which T11 writes. plan() carries five refusals with printed reasons; apply() runs rename → create → members → repoint → unit in that order, rolls the rename back if the create fails, and stops at the first failure. repoint() builds ONE modify per policy (a policy that both includes and excludes the group is rewritten once, not raced twice through /assign) and hands it to AssignEdit.applyPlan, so the fresh-read drift check and the verify read-back are the production ones. Units follow the tenant's INT-RMAU- convention with the dominant prefix detected and stripped, suggested per group and overridable. New scopes, all asked for AT THE CLICK and never at sign-in: Group.ReadWrite.All, AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All, RoleManagement.Read.Directory, and RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory ONLY on the path that creates a unit and grants a scoped Groups Administrator on it.",
      why: "HIGH. Three separate reasons, and the first is the one that matters. (1) THE NEW GROUP HAS A NEW OBJECT ID and the tool can only move half the references. It repoints the four surfaces T11 writes, NAMES the other Intune surfaces, and declares everything outside Intune invisible — but a tenant that uses Conditional Access, group-based licensing or Azure RBAC against a migrated group will have a silently broken reference until somebody reads the report and acts on it. Verify on ONE low-stakes group in a test tenant before this goes anywhere near production, and re-run T02 Group Analyzer against the ARCHIVED group afterwards: it should come back empty except for the surfaces the report already named. (2) FOUR NEW DELEGATED PERMISSIONS, two of them broad directory writes. Group.ReadWrite.All and AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All are needed to do the job at all; RoleManagement.ReadWrite.Directory rides only the create-a-unit path and exists because a restricted unit with nobody scoped to it is unmanageable by everyone. They are incremental-consent at the click, so a read-only visit to the screen acquires none of them — but the app registration's consent surface grows, and that is a conversation to have with a customer before promoting, not after. (3) IT SHARES AN ENGINE WITH T11. repoint() calls AssignEdit.applyPlan with a hand-built changes[] array; if T11's plan shape ever changes, this breaks quietly rather than loudly. The headless suite pins the shape.",

      what: "THE FILTER COUNT REACHES THE ARITHMETIC. EndpointPosture.widePredicate() turns a filtered TENANT-WIDE target into a measurement: include mode is exactly the devices FilterRules matches, exclude mode is exactly the fleet minus them. T20's fleet read swaps $select=id for FilterRules.SELECT so one read answers both questions. deviceReach gains exact/atLeast/evaluated/wideWhy beside the existing cap, and every line that states reach picks its verb from them \u2014 an exact number gets NO hedging verb at all. A GROUP plus a filter deliberately stays a bound (the intersection needs membership nobody read), and a filtered wide target alongside groups becomes a FLOOR rather than a measurement. A rule outside the grammar falls back to the old ceiling and NAMES what stopped it. Also fixed: an unfiltered wide target was capped by a filter on a DIFFERENT target of the same policy, so a policy genuinely reaching the whole fleet reported \"at most\" the whole fleet. GROUP MEMBER COUNTS MOVE INTO Docs.collect() \u2014 pooled once beside the group names, stamped on every assignment, printed by assignmentText, so T05, T19 and T20 all show \"SG-Pilot (Included) \u00b7 27 members\" from one implementation and T20 stops pooling them itself; an empty group says 0 members on purpose, an unreadable one says nothing. The filter read gains `rule`. THE BRIEF SAYS PARTLY ENFORCED: verdictWord/enforcedLine head a statement reaching less than the fleet with \"partly enforced\", spell the fraction out, and the at-rollout line says STILL PARTIAL when the destination is partial too. T20's default face becomes the LIST (reversing 10477 on live-tenant evidence). And TOOL_VERSIONS gains a rule: production is 1.0.x, beta-only is 0.x \u2014 eighteen production tools renumbered 0.N to 1.0.N with the counter carried, T20 corrected DOWNWARDS from 1.3 to 0.13, and which tools are in production read from `git show main:index.html` rather than remembered.

First, the evaluated count is only as right as FilterRules \u2014 it is the same evaluator T14 has shipped since 10498, but T14 shows it beside a rule somebody can read, whereas here it lands inside a sentence about how many machines are protected. Verify one filtered All-devices policy against the portal's own device list before trusting the rest. Second, the fleet read is bigger: eight fields per device instead of one, on tenants with ten thousand devices. Third, Docs.collect now pools a member-count read for EVERY group in the collection, so T05 and T19 got slower in exchange for the counts \u2014 on a tenant with hundreds of groups that is hundreds of pooled requests, bounded at six concurrent. The version renumber touches eighteen entries and is cosmetic, but it is the kind of cosmetic that a promotion script could read.",

      what: "NEW TOOL T21 \ud83d\udcca Secure Score visualizer (new file js/securescore.js, two halves as usual \u2014 a DOM-free SecureScore engine and a SecureScoreTool screen). Reads /security/secureScores?$top=100 and /security/secureScoreControlProfiles under SecurityEvents.Read.All, asked at the click; renders the gauge, the similar-tenant and all-tenant comparison bars, the per-category breakdown with Microsoft's two comparison figures as ticks on each bar, the timeline of every reading Graph holds, improved/regressed across it, and the improvement actions ranked CHEAPEST POINTS FIRST \u2014 an ordering openly labelled as TUNO's, not Microsoft's: points available weighted down by the published userImpact and implementationCost, a control declaring neither treated as moderate rather than low. Shaped after GCIT's Export-SecureScoreReports (Elliot Munro) \u2014 that report's anatomy, rebuilt in a tab against one signed-in tenant. Profiles are read from v1.0 with beta consulted ONLY to fill a control v1.0 left untitled (the MDE controls), and the number of titles beta filled is reported rather than absorbed. THE SNAPSHOT ROUND TRIP: Graph keeps about ninety days, so the tool exports a versioned JSON snapshot carrying the readings AND the catalogue they were read under, and uploads them back to extend the timeline; uploaded points draw as their own marks, a same-day clash resolves to the LIVE reading with the dropped count stated, and a snapshot whose tenantId differs is REFUSED, not merged. Exports: on-screen report + Markdown, controls CSV, history CSV, snapshot JSON. T20 GAINS A FOURTH RAIL NODE, \ud83d\udcca Secure Score gaps: EndpointPosture.correlate() puts the 19 best-practice checks against the score's endpoint-category controls in four buckets \u2014 both agree open, configured-here-but-unscored-there (leading, because the work is already done and is not being counted), Microsoft-scores-it-with-no-check-covering-it (a gap in the check set, listed under Microsoft's own title), and findings Microsoft does not score at all. Pairs are made by an explicit regex on Microsoft's control id or published title (SS_MAP) and every pair PRINTS BOTH NAMES; an unmatched control is listed rather than dropped, so a miss under-correlates and never mis-correlates. The node is a separate button under its own consent \u2014 T20's own read still costs no new permission \u2014 and calls T21's SecureScore.collect() rather than reading the surface twice (the T05 rule). The impact brief gains APPENDIX B, marked cut-before-sending, in Markdown, Word and the on-screen report; a brief written before the score was read carries no such section. Bookkeeping: css/app.css gains the .ss-* block, index.html gains the tile, the screen and the R02 roadmap card (moved from Next into the beta era), app.js gains the tab label, the SCREEN_TOOL entry, the tile handler and the init call. 10501 (the first live click): T21 SHIPPED WITH THREE IDS T10 ALREADY OWNED — ssBody, ssMd, ssProg — and T10's screen comes first in the document, so getElementById handed T21 the settings-search elements and every render went into the wrong screen. A consented, successful read showed a blank page: no error, no empty-state, nothing. All T21 ids move to the sc- prefix, markup and stylesheet together. The suite had not caught it because it asked the SAME wrong question — the render tests called getElementById(\"ssBody\") exactly as the tool did — so two checks are added: a document-wide duplicate-id assertion over index.html (it names all three when run against 10500's markup) and a render test that reaches through T21's own section rather than trusting an id lookup. 10502 (the first live-tenant round, three real defects): THE CATALOGUE TEXT IS HTML and nothing documents it — description, remediation and remediationImpact carry br/strong/p/ol/li tags, a href links and curly-quote entities, often malformed. 10500 escaped and printed it, so a card read as literal angle brackets; rendering it as HTML was never the alternative, because that hands a third party's markup an injection point in a page holding a tenant token. SecureScore.plain() reads the markup and discards it — structure to newlines and bullets, a link keeping its label AND its href, entities decoded — running in controlsFrom so the screen, the Markdown, the CSV and T20's node share one clean shape. THE PAGE OVERFLOWED HORIZONTALLY: a grid item's default min-width is min-content and those eighty-character portal URLs have nothing to break on, so one card widened its track, its row and the viewport, sliding the left column under the sidebar; min-width:0 plus overflow-wrap, both needed. And Microsoft's real impact vocabulary — the reference says low/moderate/high, tenants answer Low/Medium/High and very often 'Unknown', so Medium and Unknown had both been falling through an unwritten default; all are mapped now and Unknown weighs as moderate by decision. NEW: the 🗂 Cards | ☰ List seg T19/T20/T14 wear, both faces opening one popout with the full unclipped text. 10503: THE CATEGORY BARS ARE FILTERS — T19's rule (its surface stat cards are its filters). A bar click narrows the improvement actions to that category AND shows that category's own score above them (points, gaps, and Microsoft's two comparison figures for the category rather than the tenant); a chip row on the actions tab carries the same filter so it is clearable without going back for it; the list's Category cell narrows too, handled BEFORE the row's open handler so the category filters and the rest of the row opens. One `cat` behind all three. Clicking an active filter clears it; a filter carried into a view that empties it names the category and offers the way out inline, because its chip is gone by then; chips render only for categories present in the current view. The exports stay WHOLE-TENANT and the filtered card says so. 10504: ONE READ PER SESSION, NOT ONE PER SCREEN — with T21 run and its numbers on screen, T20's node still offered a button to read the tenant again, costing a round trip and (on most tenants) a second SecurityEvents consent prompt for an answer already in memory. SecureScoreTool now caches the reading with the moment it was fetched; both screens share it, T20 adopts it when the node opens, and the pane states the age, the time and the provenance rather than hiding the reuse. 10500's refusal to reuse was reasoned from a real constraint — T20 could not state such a reading's age — and drew the wrong conclusion: the fix for an unstateable age is to state it. T21's own Read button still always goes to the tenant, because an explicit click means a fresh read.",
      why: "MEDIUM: one new tool and one new node, both additive and both read-only. THREE THINGS TO WATCH. First, SecurityEvents.Read.All is on the app registration already (it has been since the registration was created FOR this card) but most tenants have never consented to it \u2014 the first click on either surface will raise an admin-consent prompt, and on tenants without an Intune-admin-plus account it will need an administrator. Second, T20's tile and screen still claim \"reads only, no new permission\" for the posture read, and that claim is only true because the Secure Score node is a button: it must never be folded into run(). Third, the correlation's pairings are the risk \u2014 control ids on this surface are provider strings Microsoft renames, so a rename silently moves a pair into the unmatched bucket rather than breaking anything, but a WRONG pair would be worse than no pair, which is why both names print on every row.

Two bugs die together: the FILTER WAS DROPPED on all four \u2014 resolved onto the assignment since 10482, read by none of them, so a filtered All-devices target exported as whole-fleet reach \u2014 and the tenant-wide chip printed \"All devices \u00b7 All devices\" because name === kind there and both were concatenated. The popout is shared with T19 and T20, so both inherit the fix. 10490: the SCOPE was wrong \u2014 /deviceManagement/assignmentFilters is DeviceManagementConfiguration.Read.All per learn.microsoft.com, not DeviceManagementRBAC.Read.All, and document.js\u0027s filters section had carried the wrong one since it was written (filters.js had it right); 10482 and 10488 propagated it into three unions. Docs.filterOfTarget()/filterReachOf() become the one reader of the raw target, keyed on the ID rather than the type \u2014 closing the split where T02/T06/T08/T09/T14 saw no filter on a target whose type was absent while T05/T12/T19/T20 saw one \u2014 and T13/T16/T12 stop counting a filter on an exclusion as capped reach. 10491: T14\u0027s list gains $expand=payloads, so used-by is answered by the first read rather than by an opt-in sweep \u2014 Filters.refsOf() reads payloadId/payloadType/groupId/assignmentFilterType off the filter itself, payload group ids are resolved once, and the scan is demoted to what only it can do (policy names). prog() stops dropping GroupUse\u0027s n-of-N. 10492: T05\u0027s browse rows name their assignments through Docs.assignmentText (two chips then +N, full list in the tooltip and the popout), filterItems() matches assignment group names, kinds and filter names, and the disabled search box carries its own reason as its placeholder instead of a paragraph underneath it. 10493: T08 and T09 both called resolveFilters() and read none of the result \u2014 whatif\u0027s effectiveState now carries a filters[] through delta rows into every surface (CSV gains a real filter column), and health\u0027s findings, Markdown and CSV name the filter on an empty-group or dangling finding. 10494: T11\u0027s noop check compares the FILTER as well as the group \u2014 an unfiltered include and a filtered one are different assignments reaching different machines, and the write path had called them identical; same group with a different filter is refused and named rather than silently done or silently skipped. 10495 (review round): payloads must be in the $SELECT \u2014 it is a structural property, not a relationship, so 10491\u0027s $expand alone would have reported 0 references for every filter on a live tenant and silently emptied T11\u0027s filter dropdown, while demo mode looked perfect; plus the Markdown heading counting a different total from its own table, a created filter hidden by the only-used view, and case-insensitive filter-id matching in the name resolver. 10496: T11\u0027s refusal is handed the filter display names so it can name them; T08\u0027s on-screen Lost table stops disagreeing with its own Markdown, its comparison cell gains the mdCell every other cell had, and its CSV column is headed Filter rather than Conditional; the filtered-exclusion fact computed at 10490 gets a chip in T13 and T16 instead of being computed and hidden; assignmentOf() routes through filterOfTarget so the one-parse claim is literally true. 10497 (layout, mockup Option B): T14 gains the \ud83d\uddc2 Cards | \u2630 List seg T19/T20 wear, cards leading so the full RULE is visible rather than cut at 160 characters; a search box over name, description, platform and rule (the last tool without one); refChips() shared by both faces; a Devices cell present on both and honestly marked not evaluated until R32; .af-bar/.af-cards/.af-rule/.af-unknown in app.css.",
