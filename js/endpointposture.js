// ======================================================================
// T20 — 🧭 Endpoint security posture (R31). The portal's Endpoint
// security blade, mirrored — Option B of the two-option mockup round,
// Mihai's pick. One read, three answers behind one rail:
//
//   * the DISCIPLINE NODES — every endpoint security policy in the
//     portal's own breakdown, T19's card language, plus two nodes the
//     portal does not have: settings catalog policies that configure
//     Defender (MDE) or Microsoft Edge without being endpoint security
//     templates, found by their setting definition ids;
//   * the IMPACT BRIEF — ENCA T32's translation layer, endpoint-side-out:
//     what a person will notice on their device, in end-user language,
//     every statement derived from a policy actually present and naming
//     the policies behind it, enforced-today and at-rollout never mixed;
//   * BEST PRACTICE — the ENCA MSLearn check shape (severity, what
//     Microsoft recommends, what the tenant has, remediation, the Learn
//     page) pointed at MDE and Edge. Checks are implemented independently
//     against learn.microsoft.com — the cross-check against ShadowDeploy
//     MDE (BUSL 1.1, not MIT) confirmed the defId families only; no code
//     or check text is taken from it.
//
// THE READ IS T05's collect(), settings catalog section — the T12/T19
// rule again: a second copy of the settings-catalog read (now with its
// per-policy settings) is how two tools start disagreeing about one
// tenant. collect() carries templateFamily since this build, so the
// discipline split reuses T16's own classifier (EndpointSec.disciplineOf)
// rather than a second family map. Legacy intents ride T16's intent read
// shape; the Windows device count is T16's denominator, same query.
//
// VERDICTS ARE THE HOUSE CLAIMS: OverviewTool.verdictOf — Assigned means
// reaching somebody BY CONSTRUCTION, excluded-only is its own finding,
// a filter caps reach at MAY. A best-practice check whose only correct
// configuration sits in a policy reaching nobody says NOT REACHING —
// configured is not enforced, and the difference is the finding.
//
// SETTING VALUES ARE THE DOCUMENTER'S ROWS — already through the
// redaction gate, choice values shortened to their last segment. A value
// the check set does not recognise is said to be unrecognised, never
// guessed: "open the policy" is an answer, a wrong verdict is not.
//
// Reads only, no new scope: the policy+settings read is the documenter's,
// intents ride the config read, the device count rides the device read,
// group names ride the directory read.

  // deduplicated, exclusions NOT subtracted, a filter capping at may.
  // Every one of those limits is worn on the line, because a device
  // number that hides its arithmetic is how a claim becomes a lie.

  // SECURE SCORE CORRELATION (R02 · T21)
  // ================================================================== //
  //
  // T20 reads POLICY: what the tenant has configured, and whether it
  // reaches anybody. Microsoft Secure Score reads the ESTATE: what the
  // devices actually report back. Those are two different questions and
  // they disagree constantly — a policy can be perfectly configured and
  // assigned tenant-wide while the score sits at zero, because the
  // machines have not onboarded, are not licensed, or have not checked
  // in since the policy was written. THE DISAGREEMENT IS THE FINDING,
  // and it is the one thing neither tool can say on its own.
  //
  // The score comes from T21's SecureScore.collect() — the one reader,
  // the T05 rule on a second surface. T20 never reads secureScores.
  //
  // ---- HOW A PAIR IS MADE, AND WHY IT IS SHOWN ----
  //
  // A check is tied to a Secure Score control by an EXPLICIT entry
  // below: a regex on Microsoft's control id, and/or one on the title
  // Microsoft publishes for it. Both are matched against Microsoft's own
  // words, never against ours.
  //
  // Control ids on this surface are not a documented contract — they are
  // provider strings that Microsoft renames — so a miss is designed to be
  // HARMLESS: an unmatched Microsoft gap falls into its own bucket and is
  // reported under Microsoft's title, and an unmatched T20 finding falls
  // into its own. Nothing is dropped by failing to match. What must never
  // happen is a WRONG pair, so every correlated row renders BOTH names —
  // the check's title and the control's title, side by side — and a
  // reader can see at a glance what was matched to what and say so if it
  // is wrong. A pairing you cannot check is a pairing you cannot trust.
